Some of them include better SEO (search engine optimization) and faster loading speeds.</h3><h3>The reason that websites that have optimized images load faster than website that do not have optimized images is becasue the optimizer tool removes data that is not necessary for the user to veiw it on the webpage. This make the loading process a lot smoother and faster.</h3> <br><h3>The image on the home page of this website had an original size of width: 852px, height:1136px and image file size of 122.9kb. In order to save bytes and make the website load faster I optimized this image with an image optimization tool on the jpeg-optimizer<a href="http://jpeg-optimizer.com/">jpeg-optimizer</a>&nbsp; website.</h3><h3>The results after the image was optimized was width:300px, height:400px and a file size of 14kb. The total savings in the file size was 88.6% and that is a lot when you think about it.</h3> </article><div id="about-img"></div></div> <footer><p class="footer">&copy;Shaman</p></footer></body></html>
